A web-based activity for estimating half of various shapes


The server code is all contained within shapes.py. I haven't commented most of it - my apologies. Send me a tweet at @emwdx and we can chat about the details.

The template files all have an extension of .tpl. These are pretty much straight HTML files that don't make much use of the templating capability of Bottle. I wanted to make a single template for all four shapes, but decided that doing so really wasn't the focus of the activity.
